Title: Impute scRNAseq Data Method
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Tao Peng; Kai Tan
Maintainer: Tao Peng <software.github@gmail.com>
Description: It aims to impute drop-out data by optimizing an objective function 
   that consists of three terms. The first term ensures that imputed values for 
   genes with nonzero expression remain as close to their original values as possible, 
   thus minimizing unwanted bias towards expressed genes. The second term ensures the 
   rank of the imputed data matrix to be as small as possible. The rationale is that 
   we only expect a limited number of distinct cell types in the samples. The third term 
   operates on the bulk RNA-Seq data. It ensures consistency between the average gene 
   expression of the aggregated imputed data and the average gene expression of the bulk 
   RNA-Seq data. We developed a convex optimization algorithm to minimize the objective function.
